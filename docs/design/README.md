This directory stores design documentation for *similarity-d*.

Japanese readers can find a translated version in [README.ja.md](README.ja.md).

Design documents come in two forms:

- **Proposals** – feature ideas or enhancements.
- **ADRs** – Architecture Decision Records for system-wide choices.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for templates and workflow details.
Existing documents are indexed in [proposals/INDEX.md](proposals/INDEX.md)
and [adr/INDEX.md](adr/INDEX.md).

Before implementing a new feature, ensure the corresponding Proposal is
**Approved** and any ADRs are **Accepted**.
